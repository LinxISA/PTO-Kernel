# Vendored PTO upstream materials

This folder keeps third-party PTO licensing and notice files.

Public headers used by PTO-Kernel are promoted to the repository root
`include/` directory for stable include paths:

- `include/common/*`
- `include/pto/*`

The original vendored source lineage is preserved through history in this
repository.
